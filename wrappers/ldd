# "ldd" wrapper for scratchbox 2, to be used in the "devel" mode
# (this wrapper requires that target tools are available
# at "/target_root")
#
# "ldd" is used to print shared libraries required by a program.
# Our problem is that it can be used to both host- and target
# binaries; this wrapper first detects the type of the binary,
# and then
#  - runs the "ldd" from /target_root for target binaries
#  - If host CPU architecture != target CPU architecture,
#    runs the binary with LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=yes if
#    it is a host binary (there were to be problems running
#    the real "ldd" from inside sb2, but running ld.so
#    with that env.variable produces the required result)
#  - If host CPU architecture == target CPU architecture,
#    assumes that all binaries belong to the target.
#    runs the binary with LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=yes 
#    with target's ld.so.
#
# FIXME: Command line options only work with target binaries!
