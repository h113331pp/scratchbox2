x-dev
#
# "gcc" has a dependency to "gnat-3.4", which has been marked "[ !arm ]" but
# that condition does not seem to work with the Debian Etch based tools
# (etch is old, and arm was not support as target arch.in it)
gnat-3.4
#
# virtual packages provided by some other packages:
libnet-perl
libdigest-md5-perl
libmime-base64-perl
